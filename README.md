## About me :man:

I have been a developer for the last 6 years, 5 years in the same company, where I have grown professionally and have learned everything by myself.

I started as a junior developer without knowing any of the languages ​​they used (php, javascript, html, css), I had only studied Python, C and Java. Over time I led a small team for one of the company's subsidiaries, and at that point I began to add my knowledge to create a common pattern when programming.
We started using JAVA for the use of Rest API and SOAP, we created small desktop applications in C# language, we developed applications for Android and IOS and most importantly, we started using Git.
Although I consider myself a full stack developer, I feel more comfortable developing the backend part. I like to optimize database queries, be it Mysql or SQL Server.

During the years that I was a part of the company, I did not place as much importance as I should on the world that is being created on Github. Yes, I am a newbie to repository collaboration but it is never too late.
I am currently learning React, Node, MongoDB and Ionic. I wish I could consider myself a MERN Full Stack.

Apart from programming, I am a reader of fantasy books and post-apocalyptic genre, I am a lover of RPG video games and I love to practice Crossfit.
